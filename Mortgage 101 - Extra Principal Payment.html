Mortgage 101 - When should I pay extra principal?


TL;DR, DON'T PAY EXTRA PRINCIPAL IN MONTHLY BASIS. DO IT RIGHT BEFORE REFINANCING, RECASTING, OR WHEN YOU CAN PAY OFF THE LOAN.


Case: Mortgage amont is $6000 in a 6 month term, here is how the payment scheduled.

(Chart1)
principal:    0  500 1000 1000 1500 2000
interest : 2000 1500 1000 1000  500    0
remaining: 6000 5500 4500 3500 2000    0
total interest paid: 6000


what if we pay extra principal in a monthly basis, say 1000

(Chart2) this is what we think
principal:    0  >500 >1000 >1000  
interest : 2000 <1500 <1000     0
extra    : 1000  1000  1000   500    
remaining: 5000 <3500 <1500     0  
total interest paid: <4500

(Chart3) but what actually happened is
principal:    0  500 1000 1000 
interest : 2000 1500 1000 1000 
extra    : 1000 1000 1000  500  
remaining: 5000 3500 1500    0
total interest paid: 5500

(Chart4) which equals to
principal:    0  500 1000 1000  
interest : 2000 1500 1000 1000
extra    :    0    0    0 3500  
remaining: 6000 5500 4500    0
total interest paid: 5500

so, paying extra principal won't reduce the interest you need to pay in the following payments (but it does reduce the
  mortgage terms).

How about if we do a 3Month-ARM, i.e. floating rate starting at month 4. Surprisingly,
  the princial that used to calculate the payment at the 4th month (with new rate) is NOT the actual
  remaining principle, it is the principal listed on the paper when you first sign it.
  Which means in Chart3 and Chart4 the principal used to calculate the 4th month payment is 4500 (6000 - 500 - 1000).

So, we should either save all the extra payments until we can pay off the loan and pay them at once. Or,
  pay a significant extra principal and do a refinancing right away.
  
  
  
###### Words from my mortgage agent ######
  
You can pay principal down little by little or you can save and do it all at once. 
  Either way your payment will not change, just the principal amount you still owe and you will shorten your payoff schedule. 
 
You probably won’t want to refinance until your rate adjusts though b/c I doubt rates will be any lower than what you have now.
  So maybe you can do a large principal reduction in the end of the 7th year and then immediately refinance.
  If so that would be a good strategy. But if you pay it down now until then by making extra to the principal periodically 
  then it would accomplish the same thing in terms of lowering your loan balance for when you would want to refinance in the
  future.
 
Just to be clear, if you make an extra payment (whether they are small ones periodically or one large one) it will go to 
  principal and reduce your loan balance.
 
Also we will allow you to recast your mortgage at any time. You would want to do this if you are putting a lot down towards
  the principal though as opposed to putting a small amount down. This is different from refinancing b/c it doesn’t change 
  the terms (i.e. rate) of the loan, rather is allows you to reamortize the payment based upon the principal reduction payment
  you make. I would just google “recast” and it will explain it a little better. But if you are interested then you can reach
  out to me for assistance or call our customer assistance team to assist as well.
