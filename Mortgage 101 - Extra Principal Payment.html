Mortgage 101 - Should I pay extra principal?

Case: Mortgage amont is $6000 in a 6 month term, here is how the payment scheduled.

(Chart1)
principal:    0  500 1000 1000 1500 2000
interest : 2000 1500 1000 1000  500    0
remaining: 6000 5500 4500 3500 2000    0
total interest paid: 6000


what if we pay extra principal, say 1000, monthly

(Chart2) this is what we think
principal:    0  >500 >1000 >1000  
interest : 2000 <1500 <1000     0
extra    : 1000  1000  1000   500    
remaining: 5000 <3500 <1500     0  
total interest paid: <4500

(Chart3) but what actually happened is
principal:    0  500 1000 1000 
interest : 2000 1500 1000 1000 
extra    : 1000 1000 1000  500  
remaining: 5000 3500 1500    0
total interest paid: 5500

(Chart4) which equals to
principal:    0  500 1000 1000  
interest : 2000 1500 1000 1000
extra    :    0    0    0 3500  
remaining: 6000 5500 4500    0
total interest paid: 5500

so, paying extra principal won't reduce the total among of interest you need to pay.

How about if we do 3Month-ARM, i.e. floating rate starting at month 4. Surprisingly,
  the princial that used to calculate the payment at the 4th month is NOT the actual
  remaining principle, it is the principal listed on the paper when you first sign it.
  Which means in Chart3 and 4 the principal used to calculate the 4th month payment is 4500 (6000 - 500 -1000).

So, we should either save all the extra payments until we can pay off the loan and pay them at once. Or,
  pay a significant extra principal and do a refinancing right away.
